# Project Kanban

This is the source of truth for project work tracking (in-repo).

## Conventions
- Cards are **one-liners**.
- If there’s a detailed spec, link it (usually a numbered plan in `docs/plans/`).
- Move cards left → right: **Backlog → Doing → Done**.
- Keep **Doing** small (WIP limit ~3).

---

## Backlog
- [ ] Make agents truly autonomous, running in the background 24/7
- [ ] Decide how background persona reads user preferences/memories
- [ ] Expand local dev docs beyond README


## Doing
- [ ] (empty)


## Done
- [x] Create in-repo kanban board → `docs/tasks.md`
